====================

Welcome. This is the Documentation for PyEmir (version |version|), 

EMIR is a **wide-field, near-infrared, multi-object spectrograph** (MOS)
installed at the Nasmyth focus of GTC_. Its MOS mode allows observers to obtain
**tens of intermediate resolution spectra simultaneously** in the nIR bands *Y,
J, H* and *K*. EMIR is designed to address the science goals of the proposing
team and of the Spanish community at large.
